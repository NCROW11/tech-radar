# API Principles

1. Our APIs will not break client software through functional evolution
1. Our APIs are re-usable where it is suitable, designed for all consumers
1. Our API design is led by research
1. Our APIs are consistently designed
1. Our APIs must perform

## 1. Our APIs will not break client software through functional evolution

* Our APIs will help our consumers build robust client software which will respond safely to change
* We will _eventually_ not force our consumers to change their software except for situations where there are legislative changes, security updates or enhancements to fraud detection capabilities
* We can safely add things to our APIs but should minimise what we do add as it is difficult to remove them later
* The key ideas inherent in our APIs need to be realised on both sides of the partnership
* Our APIs will _eventually_ minimise dependencies on out of band documentation and static design time specifications and other forms of coupling

## 2. Our APIs are re-usable where it is suitable, designed for all consumers

* Our APIs are public wherever possible
* Our APIs are designed to represent elements of our domain and processes
* Our APIs are not tailored to any particular consumer
* Our APIs enable re-use through research and design
* Our APIs provide fine grained raw data where suitable
* Our APIs provide outcomes or answers to questions where suitable
* Our APIs separate concerns
* Our APIs do not confuse our domain and the consumers domain

## 3. Our API design is led by research

* Our APIs are researched through stakeholder, design, architectural and user research
* Our research is portable, consumable by different stakeholder groups through the use of tooling and simulations
* Our research lets us deliver value early and often
* Our APIs are usable
* Our APIs are products
* Our APIs are designed with user journeys in mind

## 4. Our APIs are consistently designed

* Our APIs are unsurprising
* Our APIs are RESTful where they can be and REST is Roy Fieldings HATEOAS REST
* Our APIs are external specification compliant
* Our APIs preserve our reputation


## 5. Our APIs must perform

* Our APIs are available
* Our APIs are scalable
