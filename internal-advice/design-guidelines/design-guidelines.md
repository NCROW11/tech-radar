# Design Guidelines

Below you will find some design guidelines for the platform. These deal with the standard use cases known on the platform. These are not rules, but they should be respected and followed unless you can demonstrate that your use case doesn't fit with the below. Also, these guidelines are guidelines until we have enough use cases that require them to be changed.

The architecture teams approach to standards and guidelines is that we will create guidelines only when a need arises. We will not guess on future use cases. Therefore, if something is not handled, raise your query in #community-arch. We will also not try to resolve edge cases. If what is set out doesn't work, raise it. There's always a solution.

Finally, these may well contradict existing implementations. While we will not retrofit microservices to fit these guidelines, where there is a contradiction, these guidelines take precedent.
